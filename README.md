# test-fixtures-pattern
A simple demonstration of a fixtures test based architecture in JavaScript. A simple case study scenario is built around a function called `backgroundColorReplacer` that is exposed in main *entroypoint* file `replacer.js`.

## The case study
There's a dummy implementation of a function called `backgroundColorReplacer` that basically replaces a `background-color` css property with a `rgb` color for some other `rgb` or `rgba` color depending on the options passed to this function.

Examples of usage can be seen in the file `__tests__/replacer.test.js`.

### Unit tests
Some simple unit tests are added in `__tests__/replacer.test.js`, as a first step.
